# 🐍 Classic Snake Game

A retro-style Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics module. This project recreates the nostalgic gameplay of the classic Snake game while serving as a hands-on introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was my gateway into **Object-Oriented Programming**. I explored:
- Creating and managing classes (`Snake`, `Food`, `Scoreboard`)
- Encapsulation and method organization
- Event-driven programming with `onkeypress()` and `ontimer()`
- Debugging movement logic and refining gameplay interactions
